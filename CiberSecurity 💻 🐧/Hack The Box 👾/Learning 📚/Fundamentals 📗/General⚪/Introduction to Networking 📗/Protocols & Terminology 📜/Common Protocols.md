- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A `connection-oriented` protocol that establishes a reliable, virtual connection before sending data. It ensures all data arrives in order by using a three-way handshake, making it reliable but slower. It's used for services where data integrity is critical, like web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) and file transfers (FTP).

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A `connectionless` protocol that sends data packets without establishing a connection. It's faster but less reliable, as packets might be lost or arrive out of order. It's ideal for speed-sensitive applications like video streaming, online gaming, and DNS lookups.

- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for network diagnostics and error reporting, not data transfer. It's the protocol behind tools like `ping` and `traceroute`, sending messages like "Destination Unreachable" or "Time Exceeded".

| **Request Type**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Echo Request`         | This message tests whether a device is reachable on the network. When a device sends an echo request, it expects to receive an echo reply message. For example, the tools `tracert` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux) always send ICMP echo requests. |
| `Timestamp Request`    | This message determines the time on a remote device.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `Destination unreachable` | This message is sent when a device cannot deliver a packet to its destination.                                                   |
| `Redirect`                | A router sends this message to inform a device that it should send its packets to a different router.                            |
| `time exceeded`           | This message is sent when a packet has taken too long to reach its destination.                                                  |
| `Parameter problem`       | This message is sent when there is a problem with a packet's header.                                                             |
| `Source quench`           | This message is sent when a device receives packets too quickly and cannot keep up. It is used to slow down the flow of packets. |

- **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):** A method for making voice and multimedia calls over the internet. It primarily uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to manage these communication sessions.

| **Method** | **Description**                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `INVITE`   | Initiates a session or invites another endpoint to participate.                                                    |
| `ACK`      | Confirms the receipt of an INVITE request.                                                                         |
| `BYE`      | Terminate a session.                                                                                               |
| `CANCEL`   | Cancels a pending INVITE request.                                                                                  |
| `REGISTER` | Registers a SIP user agent (UA) with a SIP server.                                                                 |
| `OPTIONS`  | Requests information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agent, such as the types of media it supports. |

**Practical Application:**  
In penetration testing, understanding these protocols is crucial. For example, you can analyze the **Time-To-Live (TTL)** value in an ICMP response to make an educated guess about the target's operating system (e.g., a TTL near 128 often suggests Windows, while near 64 suggests Linux). Additionally, you can use SIP `OPTIONS` requests to enumerate valid usernames on a VoIP server for information gathering.
